### The Question from Atropos

Build an API to manage long running tasks

Implement operations that can at a minimum:

- Create tasks

- Check  task status

- Retrieve task results

Assume tasks may take a significant amount of time to complete (e.g., data processing tasks, report generation, video processing).  

Guidelines

- You're free to choose any language/platform/stack, just be prepared to talk about them.

- Assume that this will be production code that will need to be supported by a separate infrastructure team.

- Provide some information about how to deploy the service locally for our team to be able to review

- Build a basic front-end

[OPTIONAL] - Extra points for using:

- A containerization technology like Docker

- Testing framework

- A more advanced, feature-rich front-end

- Integration with a cloud provider's services that you think can help
